Brief Description:
---
Puyo Puyo is a tile-matching puzzle game, similar to that of Tetris and Dr. Mario. The game is played on a board of 6x12. The falling Puyos can be moved left and right, and they fall faster when the down button is pressed. Puyos fall in pairs, and can be rotated clockwise or counter clockwise by the player. When there are four or more of the same colored Puyos adjacent to each other, they will pop. “Adjacent” means connected horizontally or vertically, not diagonally. When Puyos pop, they cause Puyos above them to fall down as well. If this causes another group of four or more Puyos to be adjacent to each other, they will pop as well, and start a “chain.” In single player endless Puyo Puyo, the higher your chain count, the more points you receive.
